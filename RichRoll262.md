### My favorite quotes from Kerri
* 19:24 - I feel like your mindset in certain situations...if you can have this mental framework to where you can chill out, that's ideal 
* 31:21 - Losing hurts your heart, but just for a moment and then you go back to work
* 37:08 - I feel like I still have room for improvement in every area ... I'm not done yet
* 42:06 - We went to work (to save the marriage) ... Most people don't do the work. It's easier to walk away 
* 46:04 - I need to create my best life and it is so possible (on the topic of work life balance)
* 51:10 - I do want to get more comfortable being in silence and in stillness because that's hard for me
* 66:28 - We get in our own way a lot and that goes one of two ways 
     * A) you think you have it and you know it all so you won't lean on experts and learn
     * B) you are going to limit yourself because you are afraid to push yourself out of this box
* 66:51 - Curiosity is one of the best things in life ...
* 67:06 - Never be afraid to grow  
* 68:24 - I'm addicted to growth ... I'm so afraid to stop growing and to be stagnant
* 68:46 - Don't be afraid to be uncomfortable ... if you have a choice, always choose the growth and discomfort
* 73:01 - Being surrounded by masters who know that there is no end to progression in life
* 97:03 - Rich - "You could write a book..." Kerri - "About what?" Rich - That's the best answer ever!
